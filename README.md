# Notes

To reduce the cost of domain renewals (I own quite a few), this website that is originally hosting under [https://notedwin.co](https://notedwin.co) will be taken offline and replaced by GitHub pages.

## Overview

This GitHub Repository is a template HTML, CSS, and JavaScript website. You might have seen the same template on YouTube because this project originates from the tutorial video. Some modifications have been made to further personalize it.

Feel free to clone this repository and make it your own.
